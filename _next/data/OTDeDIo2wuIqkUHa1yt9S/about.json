I could have created this blog using wordpress or jekyll. Instead, I  built the blog [from scratch][3] as a learning project. I can now learn from tutorials and apply it to the blog. The blog project can be a journal of the learnings as well. Also, nothing beats the joy of making things work with code! \n\nIn my quest to learn, I use tools and tech that this simple blog site does not need. Hence, this site is definitely, going to be \"__over-engineered__\".\n\nThe blogs by [ponyfoo][4] and [jlongster][5] were inspirations behind this.\n\n[1]: https://github.com/anuragashok \"Anurag Ashok\"\n[2]: https://medium.com/swlh/the-beginning-of-everything-as-code-a25c4e9a75e9 \"everything as code\"\n[3]: https://theoverengineered.blog/posts/initial-post \"Intial Post - How the blog started\"\n[4]: https://ponyfoo.com/articles/most-over-engineered-blog-ever\n[5]: https://jlongster.com/Presenting-The-Most-Over-Engineered-Blog-Ever\n[6]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/anurag-ashok/","publishDate":"2020-10-01T00:00+08:00"},"__N_SSG":true}
