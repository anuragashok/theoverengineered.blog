I am currently also exploring the javascript ecosystem for web development. I am [lazy in repetitive tasks][2] and choose automation. I love all things code, and am very passionate about \"[everything as code][3]\"\n\nI live by the these quotes from famous software craftsmen :\n\n> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. \n> \n> ― Martin Fowler\n\n> It is not enough for code to work. \n> \n> Truth can only be found in one place: the code.\n> \n> ― Robert C. Martin\n\nI feel that tutorials are great, but building projects is the best way to learn.  I could have created this blog using wordpress or jekyll. Instead, I  built the blog [from scratch][4] and made it a learning project. I can now learn from tutorials and apply it to the blog. The blog project can be a journal of the learnings as well. Also, nothing beats the joy of making things work with code! \n\nIn my quest to learn, I will use tools and tech that this simple blog site may not even need. Hence, this site is definitely, going to be \"__over-engineered__\". \n\nI love feedback. [Let me know][5] if you have any. Thanks!\n\nP.S.
