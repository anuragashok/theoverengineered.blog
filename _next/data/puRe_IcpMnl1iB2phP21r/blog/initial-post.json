So decided to build this site using Jamstack practices. This post summarizes the various parts of the Jamstack eco-system used on the site. \n\n*   **Presentation Layer:** ReactJS has been on my learning list. The most popular starting points for ReactJS are create-react-app and Next.js. I eventually decided to use Next.js as it provides server-side rendering, static-site generation and serverless functions out of the box. The features can help to get the site up quickly.\n\n*   **API:** The site does not need an API at the moment. However, Next.js provides a [straightforward solution][3] to create APIs too.\n\n*   **VCS:** Github.\n\n*   **Hosting / CDN:** The site runs on Github pages. It's free and fast. It provides all the features needed for now. However, I would also like to try out services like Netlify.\n\n*   **Backend:** At the moment, the site can compile to static HTML. So I am deferring this decision until the time I need a backend.\n\nThe overall architecture of the site looks like this.\n\n![Intial Architecture][4]\n\n### References:\n\n*   https://medium.com/@gianfranconuschese/the-jamstack-return-of-the-server-side-rendering-5a1313dafc92\n*   https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction\n*   https://dev.to/eroberts/why-you-should-use-netlify-instead-of-github-pages-3on1\n\n[1]: https://initialcommit.com/blog/What-Is-An-Initial-Commit-In-Git \"What is initial commit?\"\n[2]: https://medium.com/@gianfranconuschese/the-jamstack-return-of-the-server-side-rendering-5a1313dafc92 \"Jamstack\"\n[3]: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction \"NextJS solution for API routes\"\n[4]: /diagrams/initial-post.svg","author":{"name":"Anurag"},"publishDate":"2020-12-01T00:00+08:00","tags":null,"type":"blogPost"},"__N_SSG":true}
